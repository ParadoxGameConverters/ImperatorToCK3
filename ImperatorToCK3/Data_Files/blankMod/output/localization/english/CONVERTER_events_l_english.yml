 welcome_mods_title: "IMP-CK3 Mods"
 welcome_mods_desc: "Here are some mods made with the intent to work alongside the Imperator-CK3 converter.\n\nEach option shows the name and author of the mod to make it easier to find in the workshop. Hover over each option to get a brief description of the mod. Click any of the mod options to exit this event.\n\nIf a mod shows this in the description:\n\t$welcome_mods_must_choose_in_converter$\nThat means that in order to use the mod with a converted save, it must have been chosen as a CK3 mod you were playing with when converting the Imperator save in order for it to work. But, if you see this:\n\t$welcome_mods_recommend_choose_in_converter$\nThat means it is recommended that the mod was chosen in the converter when converting the save, likely because it adds stuff like cultures/faiths that could be used when converting the save or because it is to ensure that the mod is loaded at game start, but it isn't required.\nIf the mod doesn't show either, then it doesn't need to be chosen when converting the save game, it could be added manually to the playlist after conversion."
