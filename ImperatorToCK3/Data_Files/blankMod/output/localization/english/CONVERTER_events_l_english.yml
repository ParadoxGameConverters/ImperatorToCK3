Hover over each option to get a brief description of the mod. Click any of the mod options to exit this event.\n\nIf a mod shows this in the description:\n\t$welcome_mods_must_choose_in_converter$\nThat means that in order to use the mod with a converted save, it must have been chosen as a CK3 mod you were playing with when converting the Imperator save in order for it to work. But, if you see this:\n\t$welcome_mods_recommend_choose_in_converter$\nThat means it is recommended that the mod was chosen in the converter when converting the save, likely because it adds stuff like cultures/faiths that could be used when converting the save or because it is to ensure that the mod is loaded at game start, but it isn't required.\nIf the mod doesn't show either, then it doesn't need to be chosen when converting the save game, it could be added manually to the playlist after conversion."

If you want to ensure these mechanics work properly, it is recommended you destroy your other empire titles, so that way if an AI ruler gains control of the realm, they don't change the primary title themselves. #!"

 ## Event triggered to notify the player of potential issues that could arise from having multiple empire titles while being Ritsuryo/Soryo, and options to deal with it
 irtock3_ritsuryo_events.2.title: "Issues with Multiple Empires"
 irtock3_ritsuryo_events.2.desc: "#weak It seems like you have multiple [empire|E] [titles|E] while at least one is associated with a [ceremonial_liege|E] title. This event is to notify you that this could potentially cause issues with how ceremonial lieges work.\n\nBecause of the way ceremonial lieges are coded, they heavily depend upon the [top_liege|E] of the [realm|E] keeping whatever empire title is associated with the realm's ceremonial liege as their [primary_title|E]. Otherwise, the game can struggle to recognize that you should have a ceremonial liege in your realm, what the ceremonial liege title is, and what the empire title it's associated with is, which can break those mechanics. As such, it is recommended that the extra empire titles that aren't associated with the realm's ceremonial liege be destroyed, to prevent these issues. While a player could make sure to never change their primary title, if an AI ruler happens to take control of the realm, they might change the primary title themselves, breaking things.\n\nBelow are some options on how you can handle this situation. In this case, one of your relevant held empires that has a ceremonial liege title associated with it is [realm_title.GetName|V] (Ceremonial Liege: [ceremonial_liege_title.GetNameNoTier|V]). In the tooltips for the options below, you'll also see a list of all of your empire titles that have ceremonial liege titles associated with them. If you would prefer to go with one of those other empire titles, choose the option to leave your titles alone, switch to the desired empire title, and if you want to, destroy the other empires. #!"
