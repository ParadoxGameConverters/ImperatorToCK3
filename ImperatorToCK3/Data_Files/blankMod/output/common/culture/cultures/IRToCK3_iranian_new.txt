		# Redacted notes from @nah34:
		# For Bactrian traditions, I had to improvise since the Bactrian Wikipedia page did not have
		# much information on their culture. So I used reference of Tajik people, as they were
		# one of the direct descendants of Bactrians. The vanilla CK3 Tajik culture as of CK3 1.7.2 has Caravaneers,
		# Dryland Dwellers, Futuwaa and Philosopher Culture as tradition.
		
		# Bactrian culture should have Caravaneers tradition since the region was a Silk Road trading hub.
		# (Several important trade routes from India and China (including the Silk Road) passed through Bactria and,
		# as early as the Bronze Age, this had allowed the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth
		# by the mostly nomadic population. The first proto-urban civilization in the area arose
		# during the 2nd millennium BC. (from the Bactria Wikipedia page))
		tradition_caravaneers
		
		# Bactrian culture should have Horse Lords tradition because Bactrians were excellent in cavalry battle,
		# some composed of horse archers. (Before Greek conquest, the armies of Bactria were overwhelmingly
		# composed of cavalry and were well known as effective soldiers … Herodotus describes the Persian cavalry
		# of Mardonius at the Battle of Plataea (which included Bactrians) as horse archers (hippotoxotai).
		# Bactrian infantry is described by Herodotus as wearing caps in the Median style, short spears
		# and reed Scythian style bows. (from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom Wikipedia page)).
		tradition_horse_lords
		
		# Bactrian culture could have Dryland Dwellers tradition rather than Warriors of the Dry.
		# This is a suggestion out of just balancing; Bactrian culture having
		# Stalwart Defenders, Caravanners, Horse Archers and Warriors of the Dry would make 3 of
		# their traditions military-based ones. Since Tajik culture already has Dryland Dwellers, it seemed
		# suitable to give Bactrian culture the same one.
