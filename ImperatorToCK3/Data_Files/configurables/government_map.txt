# IMPERATOR:ROME to CK3 - GOVERNMENT MAPPINGS #
###############################################

# Usage:
# link = {
#	ck3 = CK3 government ID
#	ir = Imperator government ID
#	irCulture = Imperator culture ID (optional)
#	has_ck3_dlc = CK3 DLC ID (optional; relevant IDs: roads_to_power, khans_of_the_steppe, all_under_heaven)
#	ck3_title_rank = CK3 title rank tag is converted to (optional; allows b,c,d,k,e,h)
#}
# multiple entries allowed for: ir, irCulture, has_ck3_dlc
# multiple entries not allowed for: ck3

# NOTE: Titles created from Imperator governorships do NOT use these mappings! They use the same government as their imported country.
# NOTE: ck3_title_rank allows all possible rankings in one entry. So for example, ck3_title_rank = ke will work for kingdoms and empires
