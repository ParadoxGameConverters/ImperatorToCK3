The Elamites believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses, with Humban, the sky god, being the chief deity among the highland Elamites. In Susa, the position of chief deity was occupied by Inshushinak, the ruler of the Underworld. The Elamites also believed in an afterlife, with the positive afterlife being called Muru-un and the negative afterlife being called Shaddaku."
