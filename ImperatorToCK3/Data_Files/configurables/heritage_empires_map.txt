# This file determines which heritages are associated with a predefined empire instead of a generated title
# during de jure empire setup generation.
# These mappings should only be used for empires that are named in a way that they can be undoubtedly connected
# to specific heritages (and not just because they happen to geographically match the areas of any culture groups).
# Counter examples:
# heritage_iranian = e_persia: Iranian heritage is broader than the Persian culture
# heritage_byzantine = e_byzantium: heritage_byzantine has been renamed to "Hellenistic" in the converter,
# so it wouldn't make sense to map it to a title with specific flavour about it being the continuation of Rome.

# Multiple heritages can be mapped to the same empire.
# One heritage can also be mapped to multiple empires (for example: heritage_west_slavic to e_west_slavia and e_slavia),
# but first valid match will be used.
