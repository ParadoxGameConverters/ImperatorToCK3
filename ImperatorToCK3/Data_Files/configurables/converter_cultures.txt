# This file contains converter's CK3 cultures that may be redundant in the case
# of a conversion to The Fallen Eagle or When the World Stopped Making Sense mods.

# For example: converter's gallic culture is made redundant by TFE's gaul culture.
# It's also not needed if any selected CK3 mod already has a gallic culture.
# To prevent including the culture in the conversion, add a list of cultures that
# invalidate it to the culture's definition:
# INVALIDATED_BY = { gallic gaul }

		# Aramaic culture should have Refined Poetry tradition because Aramaic language was used as a common language during the reign of Babylonian and Achaemenid Empire. They were revered for being excellent writers. (The Persians considered this Chaldean societal class to be masters of reading and writing, and especially versed in all forms of incantation, sorcery, witchcraft, and the magical arts. They spoke of astrologists and astronomers as Chaldeans, and it is used with this specific meaning in the Book of Daniel (Dan. i. 4, ii. 2 et seq.) and by classical writers, such as Strabo. (from the Wikipedia Chaldea page))

		# Aramaic culture should have Culture Blending tradition because Chaldean cultures such as Aramaic were often blended with other cultures. (The original Chaldean tribe had long ago became Akkadianized, adopting Akkadian culture, religion, language and customs, blending into the majority native population, and eventually wholly disappearing as a distinct race of people, as had been the case with other preceding migrant peoples, such as the Amorites, Kassites, Suteans and Arameans of Babylonia. (from the Chaldea Wikipedia page) / The Arameans who lived outside their homelands apparently followed the traditions of the country where they settled. The King of Damascus, for instance, employed Phoenician sculptors and ivory-carvers. In Tell Halaf-Guzana, the palace of Kapara, an Aramean ruler (9th century BCE), was decorated with orthostates and with statues that display a mixture of Mesopotamian, Hittite, and Hurrian influences.

		# Babylonian culture should also have Storytellers tradition since Babylonians (and Sumerians) emphasized the role of literature, such as the epic of Gilgamesh. (There were libraries in most towns and temples; an old Sumerian proverb averred that "he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn". Women as well as men learned to read and write. (from the Babylonia Wikipedia page))

		# Babylonian culture should have Philosopher Culture tradition as Babylonian philosophy had an influence on Greek philosophy, particularly Hellenistic philosophy. The Babylonian text Dialogue of Pessimism contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the sophists, the Heraclitean doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogs of Plato, as well as a precursor to the maieutic Socratic method of Socrates. (from the Babylonia Wikipedia page)

		# Babylonian culture should have Legalistic because Babylonia introduced one of the very first written codes in history, namely the Code of Hammurabi. (One of Hammurabi's most important and lasting works was the compilation of the Babylonian law code, which improved the much earlier codes of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria. This was made by order of Hammurabi after the expulsion of the Elamites and the settlement of his kingdom. (from the Babylonia Wikipedia page)

		# For Bactrian traditions, I had to improvise since the Bactrian Wikipedia page did not have

		# one of the direct descendants of Bactrians. The vanilla CK3 Tajik culture as of CK3 1.7.2 has Caravaneers,
		# Dryland Dwellers, Futuwaa and Philosopher Culture as tradition.

		# Bactrian culture should have Caravaneers tradition since the region was a Silk Road trading hub.
		# (Several important trade routes from India and China (including the Silk Road) passed through Bactria and,
		# as early as the Bronze Age, this had allowed the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth
		# by the mostly nomadic population. The first proto-urban civilization in the area arose
		# during the 2nd millennium BC. (from the Bactria Wikipedia page))

		# Bactrian culture should have Horse Lords tradition because Bactrians were excellent in cavalry battle,

		# composed of cavalry and were well known as effective soldiers … Herodotus describes the Persian cavalry
		# of Mardonius at the Battle of Plataea (which included Bactrians) as horse archers (hippotoxotai).
		# Bactrian infantry is described by Herodotus as wearing caps in the Median style, short spears
		# and reed Scythian style bows. (from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom Wikipedia page)).

		# Bactrian culture could have Dryland Dwellers tradition rather than Warriors of the Dry.
		# This is a suggestion out of just balancing; Bactrian culture having

		# their traditions military-based ones. Since Tajik culture already has Dryland Dwellers, it seemed

(A signature feature of Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side.[261] Use of the barrel vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs.[250] Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale.[261] The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD.[250] Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style.

		# Parthian culture could have Culture Blending since it was a heterogeneous empire, especially close to Greeks.

For about the first half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture, though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions. (Parthian Empire Wikipedia))

		# Parthian culture should have Horse Archers because Parthian empire mainly had cataphract; a cavalry army. (The main striking force of the Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor.[214] The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers.[215] Due to the cost of their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings.[216] The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle.
