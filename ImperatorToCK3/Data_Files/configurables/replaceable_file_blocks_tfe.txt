# This file contains blocks from The Fallen Eagle files that can be replaced with new ones.
# The structure is as follows:

# <file name> = {
# 	replace = {
# 		before = {
# 			some original code			
# 		}
# 		after = {
# 			some modified code			
# 		}
# 	}
#
# 	replace = {
# 		before = {
# 			some original code 2		
# 		}
# 		after = {
# 			some modified code 2		
# 		}
# 	}
# }

# INDENTATION IS IMPORTANT INSIDE the before BLOCK!
# ASIDE FROM THE CURLY BRACKETS SURROUNDING THE BLOCK, IT MUST MATCH THE ORIGINAL FILE.
# OTHERWISE THE BLOCKS WON'T BE MODIFIED!
