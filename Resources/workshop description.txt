[h1]Imperator to CK3 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the Imperator to CK3 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Imperator campaign to be transferred and continued in Crusader Kings 3, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 304 BCE to 1453+ CE, and further using our other converters to Europa Universalis 4, Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron 4.

Running a continuous campaign from Imperator all the way to HoI4 is called running a [b]mega-campaign[/b].

[h2]Converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i][/h2]
[list]
[*] This converter currently supports Imperator 1.5 and CK3 1.1. Imperator DLCs are optional, as are CK3 DLC.
[*] This mod is not intended to be enabled in game. It is only a [i]delivery vehicle[/i] for the converter's download link.
[*] You can also download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/imperator-to-ck3-release-thread.1415172/]forums thread[/url] or from Github.
[/list]

[h3]Setting up the converter.[/h3]
To set up the converter, you’ll need to follow the simple steps below:
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to the this mod.
[*] If the mod does not immediately begin downloading, you may need to start Imperator launcher to trigger the download.
[*] Go to your mod folder (usually [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\859580\2255281636[/i], or elsewhere if you moved your steam library)
[*] Inside it find and open [i]downloadLink.txt[/i]. 
[*] Within that file are direct links to the converter's stable and development versions. Pick one and download it. Development versions are fresher and usually better.
[*] Unzip the downloaded converter by right-clicking on it and selecting [i]Extract All…[/i]
[*] Finally, go to the extracted converter's directory and fire it up by running [i]ConverterFrontend.exe[/i].
[/olist]

If you downloaded the converter directly from forums or github, you only need to execute steps 6 and 7.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://imperator.paradoxwikis.com/Imperator_To_CK3_Converter]wiki page[/url].
Very generally, it takes your Imperator [b]saved game[/b] and converts it into a Crusader Kings 3 [b]mod[/b].
You then have to [b]enable that mod[/b] when starting EU4 launcher:

[olist]
[*] Create a new playset in the launcher.
[*] Add the conversion mod into the new playset, along with other mods you want to use (such as graphical ones)
[*] On the Home page of the launcher, make sure the new playset is enabled and selected before pressing Play.

When resolving issues we will always need if your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion.

We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.
